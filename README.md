This is just a Set of uBlock Origin rules which attempt to clean up the CryptoCompare website by removing the moronic junk such as; flashing ads, infantile discussion forum, useless guides, so-called news, etc] and just leaving the latest price charts and your portfolio.

Use 'Import and Append' under uBlock Origin's "My Filters" tab in the dashboard.
